# Pomodoro Timer

## Overview
The **Pomodoro Timer** is a simple productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This project provides a basic implementation of a Pomodoro Timer using Python.

## Features
- **Work Interval**: Standard 25-minute work sessions (modifiable).
- **Break Interval**: 5-minute short break intervals and 15-minute long breaks.
- **Custom Timers**: Ability to set custom work and break durations.
- **Graphical and Command-line Interface** (optional).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above.
- Optional: `tkinter` for a graphical interface (default in most Python installations).

## Usage
To run the Pomodoro timer, you can use the command-line script or a graphical version depending on your setup.

| Argument      | Description                              | Default Value |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `--work`      | Set custom work duration (in minutes)     | 25            |
| `--short_break` | Set custom short break duration (minutes) | 5             |
| `--long_break`  | Set custom long break duration (minutes)  | 15            |

### Key Features
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Start, pause, and reset timers.
- **Alerts**: Beeps or notifications at the end of each session (requires sound library).
